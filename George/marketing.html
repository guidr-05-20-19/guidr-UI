                John was trying to find an easy way to log his guided trips. 
                He loves hiking and makes a living guiding people on trips through the National Parks of Utah. 
                He would try writing a log on paper but it would be messy and unorganized. 
                It took too much time and he wasn’t keeping up with it. 
                He found Guidr when browsing hiking logs online.             </div>
